***
Hi :wave: , I'm a computer science engineer pasionate about data science :chart_with_upwards_trend: , statistics, computer vision and everything AI related. Always interested in learning new topics and improving on those I already know one step at a time.

</br>

Here, I post some projects that I've done either in college or after to learn new technologies or techniques. Lately, I've been learning some data science with Python and trying backend with Nodejs. Two of my favorite projects so far are: the one analyzing a [housing dataset](https://github.com/ivanfolg/House-Prices) from Kaggle (still working on it) and the one containing some exercises from college ([particularly the image segmentation exercise](https://github.com/ivanfolg/practicas_uni/tree/main/vision%20artificial)).
